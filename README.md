# The problem

Maybe you heard about [JSONata](https://jsonata.org/). If you didn't hear about it, it's a JSON query and transformation language

It's powerful and you can do a lot of things with it. Basically you can do [everything you can imagine](https://docs.jsonata.org)

You can [try it here](https://try.jsonata.org/) to see its power

The _problem_ is that maybe you want to see how it's going to be a JSON transformed using this framework

# This solution

JSONata Transformer uses custom editors to help you build your `Transformers` using JSONata functions and queries

You use a JSON as the input and you create a JSON structure with JSONata functions and queries on it

You can see the output in the Output box 

_This project is experimental any problems are issues feel free to raise GitHub issues or just reach out.._

# Getting Started

1. Visit [https://rubenjgarcia.github.io/jsonata-transformer-ui](https://https://rubenjgarcia.github.io/jsonata-transformer-ui).

2. Paste your JSON into the "Input JSON" editor.

3. Create a new JSON using JSONata transformers based on your input.

4. Once you are happy with your transformers you can quickly copy the result to clipboard using the editor icons.
